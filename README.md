Getting Started (Local)
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/Akshaygohrava/Pizza-Palace.git
2. Navigate into the directory:
   cd Pizza-Palace
3. Open `index.html` in your browser or use a simple static server:
   - Python: `python -m http.server 8000`
   - Node: `npx http-server .`
4. Edit content: change phone number, locations, menu items, images in the HTML files and `Stylesheets/`.

Customization Tips
- Replace placeholder images with your store photography in `assets/images/` (create the folder if missing).
- Update branding: change site title, colors in `Stylesheets/style.css`, and favicon.
- If you need dynamic functionality (orders, login, DB), integrate with a backend (Node/Express, Flask, Firebase, etc.) and convert static forms to POST/JS fetch calls.
- For production hosting: deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static host.

Accessibility & Performance Suggestions
- Add alt attributes for all images.
- Optimize images (WebP or compressed JPEG/PNG).
- Add meta tags for social sharing (Open Graph / Twitter Cards).
- Consider lazy-loading images for performance.

Contributing
- PRs, improvements, or new page templates are welcome.
- Suggestions:
  - Add real images, more menu categories, or interactive ordering UI.
  - Integrate a contact form backend or form handling service (Formspree, Netlify Forms).
- Please open issues for feature requests or bug reports.

- Add a LICENSE file (e.g., MIT) to make reuse/redistribution explicit.
